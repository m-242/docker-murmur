## Description

This is a barebones docker container built using busybox and a statically compiled version of murmurd from the [official website](https://www.mumble.info).

It's forked from [mattikus](https://github.com/mattikus/docker-murmur)'s version to add a volume containing the configuration file.

## Usage

The recommended way to run this container is as follows:

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 64738:64738 -p 64738:64738/udp mattikus/murmur
```

To have the container store the sqlite database on your filesystem instead, you can run:

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 64738:64738 -p 64738:64738/udp \
    -v /path/to/data:/data mattikus/murmur
```

## Important notes

### Getting the super-user password

On first run, if you don't already have an existing state database, you'll want to look at the logs for your container to get the super-user password: 

```bash
$ docker logs murmur 2>&1 | grep Password
<W>2014-07-27 01:41:31.256 1 => Password for 'SuperUser' set to '(mAq3hkwnkD'
```

### Providing your own murmur.ini

If you want to tweak the provided murmur.ini, you should run:

```bash
docker cp your-container-name:/etc/murmur.ini /path/to/murmur.ini
```

If you are using the built in volume at `/data/`, then you should sure your config contains:

```ini
database=/data/murmur.sqlite
```

To run the container with your tweaked murmur.ini:

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 64738:64738 -p 64738:64738/udp \
    -v /path/to/murmur.ini:/etc/murmur.ini mattikus/murmur
```
